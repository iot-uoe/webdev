Come join us for the follow-up to our previous and very popular [Programming an IoT Device in MicroPython Workshop](({{ site.url }}/2016/10/lopy-workshop-report/)) hosted by Design Informatics in October 2016.

We'll be working once again with the [Pycom LoPy](https://www.pycom.io/solutions/py-boards/lopy/), but this time with more emphasis on LoPy-to-LoPy inter-communications with LoRa. We will also be connecting up a wider array of sensors.

The workshop will be held in the new uCreate Studio at the Main Library. This has been created as a dedicated workshop space for all kinds of maker activities, and will have have pretty much everything we need.

**The event is open to both staff and students, but we are limited to 20 people in total so please [book early](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/iot-lopy-workshop-tickets-29644817447). Some familiarity with Python programming will be useful.**

Please bring your own laptop (Windows, Mac, Linux), and it would be helpful if you could pre-install the latest version of the Pycom IDE, [Pymakr](https://www.pycom.io/solutions/pymakr/). (Note that Pymakr has been upgraded significantly since the October workshop.)
