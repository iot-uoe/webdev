## Overview

Building on the success of the first [Internet of Things Research Workshop]({% post_url 2017-07-03-edinburgh-research-workshop-report %}) last July, we are expanding our scope to embrace new disciplines such as electrical engineering, civil engineering and design informatics. This is giving us an exciting line-up of topics.

We are using a deliberately generous interpretation of "Internet of Things" in order to cast our net as wide as possible. As before, our goal is to bring together people from across the University whose research contributes to this complex picture, to facilitate new collaborations, and to identify new research opportunities. Not all of the talks in the programme will present solutions or explicitly address IoT issues &mdash; we are also covering areas which are promising targets for future IoT research and applications.
