We are in the process of installing [Kerlink](http://www.kerlink.fr/en/) gateways at up to five sites across the University campus. In the first instance, data sent to the gateways will be accessed via a private instance of[The Things Network](https://www.thethingsnetwork.org).

Gateways are currently installed on following locations:

* Murray Library, Kings Buildings
* 50 George Square
* Main Library, George Square
* Argyle House

We will be installing more gateways in the course of the coming year.
